## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS (implementing variables, mixins, and import)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid (for base layout)
- Desktop-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript (DOM)

### What I learned

From this challenge I learned how to implement flex, grid, SCSS, and Basic Javascript (loop and function) and DOM Manipulation. All this time I'm just watching tutorials and following courses without actually implementing it into a real use scenario.

In this challenge, I also feel that I have improved a lot since my last coding project, OKK UI Website on July 2021. I've learned how to utilize flex and grid to further ease my layout in css instead of just using block or inline-block. Moreover, I can finally use Javascript concepts and syntax that I actually understand which I have never actually understand before (since I'm mostly just copy-pasting JS code without actually understanding the concept behind it T_T).

I also learned how to use SCSS in a real case situation. Moreover, I tried to use BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention for the CSS which I didn't continue since I'm still confused (as you can see in my html) and used camel case instead in the end. Looks like I've found something to learn next time.

I'm proud of a lot of things in my code which I can't pick to be in the snippet hall of fame (you're all awesome, codes!). But my Navbar sure is one hell of a code, a beauty, and a mess xD. I'm proud of my Navbar and embarassed at the same time since it's the most complicated and messy part of my code. Nevertheless, it's still one of an amazing experience to actually pick up a challenge and actually finish it because most of the time I just pick up challenges, which then I neglect and forgot due to my other chores (sorry!). If I'm not mistaken, it took me about 5 days to finish this challenge due to my other chores. Even though I thought about not continuing it, but in the end I commit to myself and managed to finish it even in this ocean of tasks.

Well, that's all about it. Thanks for reading this! =]

### Continued development

I will mostly try to understand more frontend development concepts. I will be trying to put my hands on React, learning about CSS BEM naming convention, and some other Javascript concepts such as promises, async await, AJAX, and OOP.

### Useful resources

- [Flex Box Cheat Sheet](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me to visualize flex concepts. I really liked this source and will use it going forward.
- [Flex Box Justify Content](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32551291/in-css-flexbox-why-are-there-no-justify-items-and-justify-self-properties) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
